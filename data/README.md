# Data

This folder contains the training, test, and evaluation data for your project.

### train

This folder contains the original base fingerprints (i.e. raw pictures), forming your database

### test
Test data for your development of the query matching. It contains:

 1. Identical copies (->100% match),
 2. Unseen (-> no match),
 3. Different degree of matches (same fingerprints, but not ideally taken i.e. rotated, blurred, etc.)

### validation
The final evaluation will take place with a larger validation dataset; the files in here are only examples to test if your code is working.
